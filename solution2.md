# Subdomain Status Checker

This Python script checks the status of multiple subdomains listed in a JSON file and updates their status every minute. The statuses are displayed in a tabular format on the screen. The script also monitors the JSON file for changes and reloads it if modified, displaying the updated statuses.


### The link to the solution repo is as follows: [Code](https://github.com/vishwesh5544/subdomain_status_checker)
I have created another repo for the solution as this could make a good standalone showcase project for my github profile.


## Note

This setup is done on Linux Pop!_OS using Neovim as the text editor.
